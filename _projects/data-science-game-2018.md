intro: |
  Data Science Game was a yearly competition sponsored by [Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/) and supported by Microsoft, Axa, BNP Paribas and Cdiscount and other companies heavily involved in data science.

  In 2018, the competition went into its fourth round, and focused on drop-off analysis for a e-commerce platform. Specifically, teams were tasked to best predict when a customer would leave during a search and purchase process.

      Our Team, Snow Clue, placed first with an innovative approach of using
      convolutional sequence-to-sequence LSTMs for short to intermediate
      snow cover forecasting and took the first place in that category.
      I developed the entire deep learning pipeline, including data preparation,
      validation and optimization. My team developed a web application to 
      visualize results and make them easily accessible.
